// PART 8 FriendButton Component

// Standard imports
import axios from "../../Middleware/axios";

// Hooks

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
// useState because our components have state
// useEffect: request upon when the component renders

// <FriendButton/> appears only as a child of the OtherProfile component created in Part 5.
// The purpose of FriendButton is to allow users to friend and unfriend other users.

export default function FriendButton(props) {

    // needs to get passed the id of the user that we are currently viewing
    // we will either want to:
    // (1) befriend that user, (2) cancel a request we made in the past,
    // (3) accept a pending friend request or (4) end our friendship
    // the id of the otehr user lives in the OtherProfile component

    // You will need to have a property in state, called buttonText,
    // and the <button> itself should render whatever text is in buttonText property in state

    // in the useEffect we will want to make a request to the server to find out
    // our relationship status with the user we are looking at, and send over
